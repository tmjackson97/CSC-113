## Comparative Analysis
[Write 2-3 paragraphs comparing the tools. Which excelled at what?

All three AI tools produced accurate and usable responses across the four prompts, but their strengths became clearer when comparing speed, structure, and depth. Gemini 3 Flash and ChatGPT consistently delivered the fastest responses, making them ideal for time-sensitive tasks like quick explanations, brainstorming, or structured outputs for assignments. Gemini’s responses were concise and efficient, often getting straight to the point with minimal excess detail, which works well for straightforward informational tasks.

Claude, while slightly slower, showed a more conversational and cautious style. Its responses felt less dense and somewhat less structured, but still accurate and readable. This makes Claude suitable for drafting reflections, discussion posts, or content where tone and clarity matter more than speed or technical precision. However, compared to Gemini and ChatGPT, Claude’s answers felt less complex and sometimes lacked the extra polish needed for technical or academic submissions.

Overall, ChatGPT stood out as the most balanced tool. It combined fast response times with clean formatting and consistently strong structure, especially for problem-solving and multi-step tasks like the 30-day GitHub plan. While Gemini is an excellent backup for speed and Claude can be useful for more narrative-driven work, ChatGPT’s versatility, familiarity, and breadth of available models make it the best all-around choice for both academic and practical use.

**Tool**: ChatGPT  
**Reasoning**: AI tool that I am most familiar with. Has decent enough answers and responses times on top of many different GPTs that you can utilize on the paid version.   
**Backup Plan**: Switch to Gemini.
