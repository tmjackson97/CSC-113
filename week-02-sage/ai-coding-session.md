# AI-Assisted Coding Session — Week 2

## The Task
Build a prompt tracker script in Python.

## My Initial Prompt to Kevin
[Paste the exact prompt you used]

## Kevin's Initial Response
[Paste or summarize what Kevin gave you. If the response was very long,
 summarize the key parts and note the total length.]

## Did the Code Work on First Try?
[Yes/No. If no, describe what went wrong.]

## The Back-and-forth
[Describe the conversation. How many exchanges did it take to get 
 working code? What did you have to clarify? What did Kevin get wrong?]

### Exchange 1: [Brief description]
**What I asked**: [Summary]
**What Kevin said**: [Summary]
**Result**: [Worked / Didn't work / Partially worked]

### Exchange 2: [Brief description]
[Same format — add as many exchanges as you actually had]

## The Improvement I Requested
**What I asked for**: [Your request]
**What changed**: [What Kevin modified]
**Did it work?**: [Yes/No/After adjustments]

## Code Understanding Check
Answer honestly — this is about learning, not looking smart.

1. Can I explain what every line of `prompt_tracker.py` does?
   [Yes / Mostly / Some parts / Not really]

2. If I had to modify this script without AI help, could I?
   [Yes / Probably / I'd struggle / No]

3. What's one thing in the code I want to understand better?
   [Your answer]

## Reflection
[Write 2-3 paragraphs reflecting on this experience:
 - How did AI-assisted coding compare to what you expected?
 - What did Kevin do well? What did Kevin get wrong?
 - What's the right balance between "AI writes it" and "I write it"?
 - How will you use AI coding assistance going forward?]
