# SAGE: My Study Assistant & Guide Engine

## What is SAGE?
SAGE is a personal AI-powered study assistant designed to support learning throughout the semester. SAGE acts as a guide to understand new concepts, organize ideas, and to reflect. I’m building SAGE to improve efficiency, comprehension, and develop better study habits while learning how to work with AI tools.

## How I'll Use SAGE This Semester
* Clarify difficult concepts from lectures or readings in plain language

* Brainstorm outlines and ideas before writing assignments

* Review and refine my own written work for clarity and structure

* Ask follow-up questions when I’m confused or stuck

* Help organize notes, study plans, and project steps

## Tools I'm Using
- **Primary**: ChatGPT - I’m most familiar with it, and it provides responses that work well for studying and problem-solving.
- **Secondary**: Gemini - I’ll use this as a backup when I want a different perspective.
- **For Special Tasks**: Claude - for coding-related help and understanding programming syntax.

## Ground Rules for Working with AI
* I will use AI as a learning aid, not as a replacement for my own thinking or effort.

* I will always read, understand, and revise AI-generated content before submitting work.

* I will not submit AI output as my own without modification or reflection.

* I will use AI to ask better questions, not just to get answers.

* I will follow all course policies regarding ethical AI use.
